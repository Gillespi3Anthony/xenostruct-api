                     <li>The rules governed below are meant to be a guide of conduct to maintain friendly but competitive behavior on the server. These are not meant to be regarded as strict guidelines in how the <strong class="admin">Admin </strong>can address a situation on the server; therefore, the <strong class="admin">Admin</strong> can handle situation differently than outlined in this set of <strong>Rules </strong>so long as no favoritism is shown.</li>
                     <li>
                        If any player feels that <strong class="admin">Admin</strong> abuse is occurring, please report it on the Discord linked on this page.
                        <ul>
                           <li>Note: Do not spam <strong class="admin">Admin</strong> abuse into chat to try to stir up the player-base. That would fall into a violation of the <strong>Chat</strong> rules outlined below.</li>

                     </li>

                     <li>
                        Please do not perform or participate in toxic chat. This includes but is not limited to:
                        <ul>
                           <li>Flaming or being “salty” towards other players.</li>
                           <li>Raging or directly engaging another player in a battle of insults.</li>
                           <li>Arguing or disagreeing with another player in an unhealthy manor as determined by the <strong class="admin">Admin </strong>and/or other players.</li>
                           <li>Any other toxicity as determined by the <strong class="admin">Admin</strong>.</li>

                     </li>
                     <li>
                        Violation of the <strong>Chat</strong> rules will result in the following:
                        <ul>
                           <li>A warning will be issued by the <strong class="admin">Admin</strong> in order to try to calm the chat and restore the peace.</li>
                           <li>The player(s) involved will be muted from chat for an indeterminate time as set by the <strong class="admin">Admin</strong>.</li>
                           <li>If the entire chat becomes out of control, global chat will be disabled for a period of time in order to allow the toxicity to pass.</li>
                           <li>If the <strong>Chat</strong> rules are continually broken, or if it is determined as necessary by the <strong class="admin">Admin</strong> a ban of fitting duration can be issued at the discretion of the <strong class="admin">Admin</strong> handling the incident.</li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>

                     <li>
                        Do not camp or spawn kill other players.
                        <ul>
                           <li>Note: Repeated killing can occur during an online raid, so raids can fall into a gray area depending on the circumstances. An <strong class="admin">Admin</strong> can make a case by case determination here, but in most instances if a raid occurs, this will not be seen as camping. Reference the <strong>Raiding</strong> rules section.</li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        Do not grief another player in any manner. Including but not limited to the following:
                        <ul>
                           <li>Violating any of the rules referenced under the <strong>Chat</strong> rules.</li>
                           <li>Violating any of the rules referenced under the <strong>Raiding</strong> rules.</li>
                           <li>Do not harass another player via voice chat or any other means.+</li>

                     <li>Cheating will not be tolerated in any form. Please do not use hacks.</li>
                     <li>Violation of the <strong>Conduct </strong>rules will be handled according to the noted actions, or at the discretion of the <strong class="admin">Admin</strong>.</li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <strong>Grouping</strong>
                  <ul>
                     <li>Please limit the number of players per base to a maximum of 4, that includes bagged players that do not live at the base as well. That is to say, do not have 5+ players with an available bag to spawn to at any one base.</li>
                     <li>Alliances are allowed to grow past the 4 player limit, but they cannot raid together with more than four players at any one time.</li>
                     <li>“Compounds” like Alliances could be considered any grouping of bases where several players or factions have teamed up. This is allowed but it should follow the other provisions mentioned in the <strong>Grouping</strong> rules.</li>
                     <li>If a grouping or raid team is questioned, it will fall under the discretion of the <strong class="admin">Admin </strong>regarding how to address the report. We do not want any “zerging” to occur through the use of grouping or alliances.</li>
                     <li>
                        Violation of any or all of the <strong>Grouping </strong>rules will result in the following:
                        <ul>
                           <li>The first violation of the rule will result in either a warning.</li>
                           <li>The second violation will result in a 48-hour ban.</li>
                           <li>The third violation will result in a ban for the remainder of the wipe.</li>
                           <li>The fourth violation will result in a permanent ban regardless of the previous actions taken.</li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>

               </li>
               <li>
                  <strong>Raiding</strong>
                  <ul>
                     <li>The maximum group size for a raid is 4.</li>
                     <li>
                        Do not raid the same base within a 48-hour period.
                        <ul>
                           <li>Note: I cannot expect you to know who owns which base, so if the same person has another base then it is fair game. If the raid was not successful then thus rule does not apply.</li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        Raiding is not necessarily griefing, but please refrain from:
                        <ul>
                           <li>Jailing, walling or otherwise locking a player into or out of their own base.</li>
                           <li>Walling, blocking or locking the cabinet before or after clearing the authorization.</li>
                           <li>Turning a players turrets against them, or placing new turrets to grief them at their own base.</li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        Violation of any or all of the <strong>Raiding </strong>rules will result in the following:
                        <ul>
                           <li>The first violation of the rule will result in either a warning or a 48-hour ban at the <strong class="admin">Admin's </strong>discretion</li>
                           <li>The second violation will result in a 48-hour ban or a ban for the remainder of the wipe depending on the action taken for the first violation.</li>
                           <li>The third violation will result in a permanent ban regardless of the previous actions taken.</li>
